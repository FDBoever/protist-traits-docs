# Design decisions

This section documents *why* EukTrait is built the way it is. 


## an attempt to document well
We aim to sufficiently document key descisions, to ensure transparancy and allow the system to evolve

examples:
- modelling morphology as features rather than as controlled vocabularies  
- separating taxa, materials, and sources from trait assertions  
- adopting historical terminology despite known ambiguity  
- integrating flat, tabular trait databases into an assertion-based model  
- choosing when to normalise vs. when to preserve heterogeneity in terminology
