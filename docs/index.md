# EukTrait

EukTrait is a framework for capturing and organising trait information in microbial eukaryotes. It is built around the simple idea that every statement about a trait — an *assertion* — should be traceable to a taxon, a source, and a biological context.

Trait knowledge in protists is messy. Terminology varies, measurements differ, and conflicting observations are common. Not unlike the organisms themselves, which are often plastic, unconventional, and full of surprises. Instead of ignoring the mess, EukTrait attempts to make it readable, comparable, and meaningful.

This site documents the principles behind the project, the ontologies that define traits and features, and the design decisions that guide how data are integrated. It is meant to inform and attract collaborators, curators, and fellow protist enthusiasts - anyone interested to explore, contribute, and help this collective effort.
